Below changes were made to bashrc file:

~/model_systems directory path must be added to PYTHONPATH so that the database molule can be used.

--
# Add conda to path
export PATH=~/opt/anaconda3/bin:$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=~/MEHTAP/model_systems:$PYTHONPATH
--

Alternatively, /model_systems/database directory could be set up to Anaconda library.
